# ChatGPT-Case-Study

The git repository covers a case study on the topic of Examining Public Opinion: A Case Study on Twitterâ€™s Communicaton
and Google Trends Searches for ChatGPT. 

It contains the data and the python script that has been used to conduct the ChatGPT Case Study as well as the data visualization with Tableau. The data and results can either be obtaned from the generated csv files or can be directly loaded into a MySQL Database with the MySQL dump files. 
For further analyis, the python notebook can be used. In this case, the log in details to the database and the paths to files need to be adjusted. 

Additional files (Raw Twitter Kaggle data set, preprocessed Twitter csv data and MySQL Dump with the Twitter data) can be taken from the following link since the file sizes are too big to upload on GitHub:
